step 1:To begin making the Homemade Nachos recipe, firstly knead the flour. In a bowl add the flours, 1 tablespoon oil, required salt and mix with your fingers.

step 2:Add water slowly and gradually knead a roti like dough.

step 3:Knead for good 5-6 minutes to release all air in the flour so that the nachos are crispier.

step 4:Leave the dough to rest for 10 minutes and knead for a minute to smoothen again.

step 5:To make tortillas, make medium size rotis/tortillas and keep them separate. The thickness should be like rotis. Now, semi-cook them on a flat griddle or pan. Please donâ€™t cook them brown them like rotis.

step 6:We just have to cook them a bit to evaporate the moisture so that they are crisp when fried.

step 7:Cut the tortillas into triangular cuts to make nachos and fry them on medium high flame in a deep fry pan till they turn crisp.

step 8:Once they are ready, take them out on a tissue papaer to absorb the extra oil. Sprinkle come Barbeque masala on freshly fried nachos and Homemade Nachos is ready to be served.

step 9:Serve Homemade Nachos with Melon Salsa, Spicy Mexican Salsa Verde or any other Salsa of your choice.
